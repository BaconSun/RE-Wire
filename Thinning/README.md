Implementation for the thinning and segmentation of image curves

Introduction:
	We provide the source code of the thinning and segmentation of image curves as the preprocessing of our main algorithm. The input is an image with image curves extracted, and the outputs are the thinning result, the segmentation result and the file of coordinates of the  points on segmented image curves. 

Platform:
	The code was developed and tested on Windows 10 x64 with Matlab R2016a x64.
	
Run examples:
    In MATLAB, directly run main.m.
