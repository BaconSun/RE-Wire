Implementation for 3D Candidate Curve Generation (Section 4.1 of our paper)

Introduction:
	We provide the source code of 3D Candidate Curve Generation for users to develop on the code. After compiling it as .exe, please put the .exe together with ANN.dll and opencv_corexxx.dll in the folder "matlabExe" (under the folder "Final"). After that, directly run end2end.m (in the folder "Final").
	
Dependencies:
	Eigen 3.2.9
	Ann 1.1.2
	OpenCV 2.4.9
	(If Visual Studio 2015 x64 is used to compile, all the three packages are included in the externallibs so that nothing needs to be installed.)

Platform:
	This part of code was developed and tested on Windows 10 x64 with Visual Studio 2015 x64.
