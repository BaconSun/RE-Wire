Implementation of The 3D Curve Selection (Section 4.2 of our paper) and the 3D wire decomposition (Section 5 of our paper)

Introduction:
	We provide the source code of 3D Candidate Curve Generation for you to develop on the code. After compiling it as .exe, you can put the .exe together with ANN.dll and opencv_corexxx.dll to the folder "matlabExe" (under the folder "Final"). After that, you can directly run end2end.m (in the folder "Final").
	
Dependencies:
	Eigen 3.2.9
	Ann 1.1.2
	OpenCV 2.4.9
	(If you use Visual Studio 2015 x64 to compile, all these three packages are included in the externallibs so that you do not need to install.)

Platform:
	This part of code was developed and tested on Windows 10 x64 with Visual Studio 2015 x64.
	
Parameters:
	The parameters are written in the setup_NL.m (in the folder "Final").
